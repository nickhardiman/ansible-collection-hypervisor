A simpler version of the far superior 
https://github.com/sscheib/ansible-role-rhel_iso_kickstart/[ansible-role-rhel_iso_kickstart role by Steffen Scheib].
Check out this code:

This smaller version is more fitting for my smaller brain.

I wrote role https://github.com/nickhardiman/ansible-collection-platform/tree/main/roles/iso_rhel_download
to download RHEL install DVD ISO files after the hypervisor is installed.
ISO files can be downloaded using one of Red Hat's APIs.
Anyone with an RHSM account can use Red Hat's APIs.

You can download Red Hat software after authenticating with an OAuth2 token.
For no good reason, both the API token and the Hub token are called "offline tokens".

File downloads are identified by SHA256 checksum, not file name.
Use the Subscription Management API to find the image you want and the right checksum for it.
(!!! Why not figure this out automatically?)

== try in a web browser

Subscription Management API endpoint has a Swagger API documentation page here:
https://access.redhat.com/management/api/rhsm
use a web browser to try it out. 

* URL: https://access.redhat.com/management/api/rhsm
* Action: Get /images/rhel/{Version}/{Arch}
* Version:  9.2 
* Arch:  x86_64

This returns a list of ISOs you can find at https://api.access.redhat.com/management/v1/images, like this.

== try with curl

Using a web client like curl requires a JWT.
Open the API token page https://access.redhat.com/management/api. 
Click the "Generate Token" button to display your new token.
